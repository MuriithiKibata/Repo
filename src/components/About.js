      <h1 className='abt'>Story Behind The Project</h1>
       <p>I've always wanted make to an store tracking system or rather an ERP, due to the challenges people are facing in the 
        industries out there, with the systems currently on market. I have family who work in a hospital, which has a system that handles the hospital's stock as well as other things.
        However the system has a tendency of crashing every so often which paralyzes some processes, and greatly impedes the progress of others.
        I've always said to myself if I can design one that is simple to use, reliable, and fast, I'm sure it would help many people, because, the hospital cannot be the only one struggling with the  issue. 
         There are things that aren't as good as I'd this project eg. the search feature isnt working as well as I'd like  to work,
        and I need to figure out how to make quantity and price increment and dreacrement because the way it is right now, its tedious to add anything. Other then that, I think this is a good start. </p>
